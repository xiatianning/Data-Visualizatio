## Description
This is a data visualization application. There are two major sections in the application: one section that allows to modify a data set, and one section that displays a visualization of the data set. A data set consists of a series of entries (numbers). You can add entries to and remove entries from the dataset. There are five different types of visualizations: a line graph, a standard bar chart, a bar chart that also displays some statistical information about the data set, a pie chart, and a box plot. Colour schemes for the visualizations can be picked in the toolbar. Statistical information is displayed on top-left corner of each visualization, which are the mean, the SEM, and the five number summary.
